        <p class="project_text">
          FÍS is expanding into secondary schools. The challenge is to
          conceptualise an identity that bridges the primary and secondary
          levels, maintaining FÍS’s recognisability while appealing to an older
          student demographic. The new identity should reflect the core values
          and objectives of the FÍS project while also appealing to post-primary
          school students and their teachers. The identity should support the
          teaching of film and drama in the classroom.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">My Approach</p>
        <p class="project_text">
          I chose to move away from the primary FÍS visual identity, which
          featured subdued colours and outdated film equipment such as film reel
          strips, film cameras, and ticket stubs. As the main graphic
          inspiration for the identity I modernised the design by incorporating
          digital and online film elements, paired with bright, fun colours to
          reflect the exciting subject matter and engage a young, enthusiastic
          audience.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">Audience</p>

        <p class="photos_text">
          At FÍS post-primary we empower students to explore the art of
          filmmaking as a dynamic tool for storytelling, creativity, and
          collaboration. Our mission is to inspire young minds to express their
          unique voices through hands-on experience in script-writing, camera
          work, set design, and more. We aim to cultivate a passion for the
          visual arts while fostering critical thinking, teamwork, and
          confidence, preparing students to engage with the world as informed
          creative individuals. We are on hand as an easy resource source for
          students and teachers alike.

        <p class="photos_text">
          My research for this project included a
          <b>brand audit</b> of the existing FÍS visual identity—examining its
          logo, assets, and overall design language—as well as a
          <b>competitor analysis</b> of similar film education initiatives. I
          also conducted <b>interviews</b> with stakeholders and teachers
          involved with FÍS. Based on these insights, I developed
          <b>personas</b> to represent each of the key audience groups.

          I developed three logo concepts to present to FÍS stakeholders and
          selected one as the foundation for the visual identity. I chose to
          retain the existing brand colours for easy recognisability. I designed
          a stationery suite—including A4 and DL envelopes, letterheads,
          compliment slips, and business cards. Feedback from stakeholders and
          lecturers revealed that the identity felt too corporate for a
          post-primary school audience. Later, I simplified the logo and
          refreshed the design with brighter, more engaging colours.
