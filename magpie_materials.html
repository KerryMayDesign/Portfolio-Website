          Work within the ethos of The Good Guide to create a proposal that
          benefits students, the college, and design practices. The Good Guide
          is based on three main pillars: People, Planet, and Tech. Choose one
          pillar and develop a brief to inspire positive change. Create
          branding, mockups, and a motion graphic to promote your experiential
          design solution.

        <p class="bold">My Approach</p>
        <p class="project_text">
          Given my love of nature, I was most drawn to the Planet pillar of The
          Good Guide. I chose to focus on creating a re-use facility within the
          college where students could share surplus resources. I came up with
          the brief: How can we encourage students to share surplus materials,
          fostering a circular economy that lowers costs, reduces waste, and
          minimises IADT’s carbon footprint?

          The Good Guide is an initiative aimed at equipping students of
          creative arts, design, media, and technology with the knowledge and
          tools to embrace ethical and inclusive practices in their work. At its
          essence, The Good Guide promotes sustainability, equality, diversity,
          and inclusion (EDI), and harnessing technology for positive impact.
          The objective is straightforward: to minimise harm in creative
          pursuits and actively contribute to positive change.

          I explored green initiatives at other colleges and businesses before
          deciding on a reuse facility. I investigated available spaces on
          campus—such as unused rooms and cupboards—and found that standalone
          units, like those at the University of the Arts London, would be most
          effective given our limited space.

          I needed a distinctive icon for the map to mark each unit’s location,
          one that reflected the brief’s ethos and stood out among other campus
          icons (e.g. toilets and the canteen). The magpie was ideal, as it’s
          widely recognised in Ireland as a collector of abandoned materials.

          I chose these colours for their alignment with the Go-Green ethos,

          better visibility.
